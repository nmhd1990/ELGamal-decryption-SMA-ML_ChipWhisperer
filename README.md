# ELGamal-decryption-SMA-ML_ChipWhisperer
New Single-Trace Side-Channel Attacks on a specific Class of Elgamal Cryptosystem


There are two C codes for ELGamal decryption by using Square-and-Multiply Always (SMA) and Montgomery Ladder (ML) Exponentiation algorithms. These code are fit with ChipWhisperer systems (an open-source toolchain for side-channel power analysis and glitching attacks) and also let you set Chipertext, Modulus.
